Write your front-end with html-like code and copy snippets to create the client or server-side application you need to communicate with your API. Write once and export to all supported platforms with minimal effort. Compatibility should never be hard.

Mud is:
- **M**odern (Compiled and Reactive)
- **U**niform (The same across all platforms)
- **D**OM-Less (No Virtual DOM is used)
